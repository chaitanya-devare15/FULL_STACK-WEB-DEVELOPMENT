    <!-- Poem -->
    <p class="poem">
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
        My name is <span class="ozymandias">Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings;<br>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare,<br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.
